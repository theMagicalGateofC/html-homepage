             <p>Self-development has been at the center of my life for a long time. By using different techniques and tools, I try to get to know myself even better, thereby achieving a state of inner harmony and awareness. My goal is to show others my experiences and methods along this path. I believe that a more conscious life is available to anyone who is willing to delve into themselves and is open to change. My guidance does not offer a predetermined route, but rather encourages the individual to discover the most appropriate and inspiring path towards a balanced and conscious life through their own decisions. The decision is always in the hands of the individual, and I am here to support you in self-knowledge and self-leadership on this fascinating and exploratory journey.
                What tools do I use?
                During the therapy sessions, I combine the use of verbal tools, different point of view switching techniques, the application of different energetic body treatments for those who are interested, or even the involvement of the arts. In accordance with the needs, I apply the techniques I have already learned in a completely personalized way so that this individual can achieve his goal.</p>

        <p>How many judgments, points of view, and beliefs have we taken from childhood and made it a fundamental part of our lives or a permanent feature by only hearing it from others?
            If we don't live consciously, they all become an automatic response system in our lives without us controlling it.
