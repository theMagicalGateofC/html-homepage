        <h2>Skills</h2>

               <h3>Leadership skills</h3>
               <p>
                I am open and I really enjoy getting to know other people. I am usually the center of attention in groups, motivate others and act in a solution-oriented manner in conflicts. <br />
                This also helped me at my last job. As managing director, I have gained even more experience in the areas of independent work and reliability, combined with accuracy, the ability to work in a team and a sense of responsibility. <br />
                It was easy for me to guide, motivate and delegate tasks to my employees. <br />
                I can quickly identify and complete pending tasks, such as ordering goods, creating rosters, etc. <br />
                I keep an overview and ensure that work is completed in a timely manner depending on the urgency. Accuracy is a given for me in these tasks. <br />
                In my private life, I handle all administrative matters for my family and my husband's company.

                <h3>Analytical thinking</h3>
                <p>
                    As a teenager, I always helped my father with manual tasks (assembling furniture, painting rooms and renovating entire apartments). <br />
                    Later, as a kitchen planner and safety engineer, I further developed skills such as analytical thinking and solution orientation. <br />
                    By planning in each area, I needed my spatial imagination and complex analytical thinking so that I could create entire systems or kitchens logically and according to regulations.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Friendly and professional appear</h3>
                <p>
                    I am very social, friendly and make sure that those around me are doing well. <br />
                    It is very important to me that everyone feels comfortable. How you appear is important. <br />
                    Thanks to all the work I carried out, I was able to refine these skills, have a friendly, professional demeanor and maintain good relationships with customers and colleagues. <br />
                    These skills made it easy for me to finally resolve complaints with satisfaction, receive new orders and win new customers.
