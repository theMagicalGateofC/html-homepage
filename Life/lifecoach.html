    <h2 class="title">Art Therapy</h2>
        <p class="art-description">The goal of the person participating in therapy is to express their feelings and thoughts through various creative activities. Art therapy is recommended for everyone from young children to the elderly, as it provides individuals with the opportunity to express themselves, process their emotions and develop creative thinking, thus helping mental, emotional and spiritual health.</p>
        <p>This is how you get to know yourself more deeply. In addition to this, it has many other advantages:</p>
            <ol>
                 <li> Verbal communication is difficult for many. In such cases, artistic activities such as painting, drawing or sculpting allow people to express themselves in visual form.</li>
                <li> Through the engagement and recreation offered by creative activities. The therapy has a relaxing effect, reducing stress and anxiety.</li>
                <li> It allows individuals to gain deeper self-awareness as the works created through artistic activities can reflect emotions, desires and hidden thoughts.</li>
                <li> Creating works and honestly expressing yourself gives you the opportunity to strengthen your self-confidence and increase your self-esteem.</li>
                <li> Creative activities also develop thinking and problem-solving skills, which affect other areas of life as well.</li>
            </ol>
