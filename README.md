Hi IÂ´m Alexandra 
I consider myself a cheerful and open person who sets high standards for her work and his appearance.
For me, creativity and authenticity are very important because we are all unique.

If I'm not playing with my 4 cats, I'm working on being happy and conscious, motivated, and helping those around me.
